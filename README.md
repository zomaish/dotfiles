# Dotfiles (Dave Lucia)

My OS X dotfiles.


## How to install

This will overwrite any existing dotfiles you have, so back them up first! You can store user-specific configs in `~/.bash_profile.local`.

1. Clone into ~/.dotfiles

        $ git clone https://github.com/davydog187/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles


2. Execute dotfiles script

        $ ~/.dotfiles/bin/dotfiles

## TODO

* Migrate over to vundle from pathogen. This will allow automatic fetching of vim plugins

## Current Plugins:
1. ctrlp - Fuzzy Completion

2. nerdcommenter - commenting features

3. nerdtree - Directory navigation

4. vim-javascript - javascript syntax highlighting

## Theme

I am using this with the Solarized Dark theme for OSX Terminal found here:
